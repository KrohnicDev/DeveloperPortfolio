# Othello

[Othello](https://github.com/KrohnicDev/Othello) is classic Othello game with customization, local multiplayer, and a simple AI opponent.

Main objectives:
- fully customizable board
- working AI that can beat regular human players
- testing different input methods in UIKit (slider, picker, toggle)

The game engine supports all possible board sizes. Only restriction is that rows and columns are multiples of 2, because otherwise the starting position couldn't be defined.

The AI has two different strategies. For now, the selection is predefined in the code, but that could be easily changed in the future. AI works equally well with all possible board sizes.
